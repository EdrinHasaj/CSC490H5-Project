The Machine Vision Problem we are Addressing:
- Our goal is to employ a deep learning model to recognize patterns in chest X-ray images for the purpose of detecting thoracic diseases. This process involves identifying the presence of 14 thoracic diseases such as pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and more.

Name of Dataset You Plan to Use
- ChestX-ray14 dataset

Location of the Dataset
- The dataset was created by National Institute of Health (NIH) and can be downloaded from Kaggle (National Institutes of Health, 2018).

Project Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning system to classify thoracic diseases from chest X-rays using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We address challenges like:
- High class imbalance
- Multi-label disease co-occurence
- Noisy medical imaging
- Rare disease detection

We propose a novel approach using:
- Gamma Correction for brightness/contrast enhancement
- CNN/CNN-Transformer based models with transfer learning
- Ensemble optimization via Differential Evolution (DE) + Forward Greedy Selection
- Grad-CAM for model interpretability and visualization.
